> **IMPORTANT:** You do not install this App directly, it is included in the Directus Suite, located here: [`directus/directus`](https://github.com/directus/directus). This repository is only used to help organize the codebase.

## Description

The Directus Admin Application is a Vue.js powered SPA designed to work with the Directus API to let the user manage all the data in the connected project. It's the GUI of working with the data in a Directus installation. 

## Installation / Usage

**IMPORTANT:** Unless contributing to the project, you shouldn't build the App from source. Use [`directus/directus`](/directus/directus) instead.

1. Clone the repo
2. Install the depencencies using `yarn`
3. Run `yarn build` to compile the app to a production bundle.

## Development

You can run the application standalone using the included dev server. Run `yarn serve` in your terminal to fire up the Directus App with Hot Module Reloading and the Vue Devtools integration enabled.

By default, the application will connect to the demo API (https://demo.directus.io) when running in development mode. To connect to your own local API, provide the URL in the `API_URL` environment variable:

```
API_URL=http://localhost:8888 yarn serve
```
