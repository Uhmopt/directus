# Hover (util)

```html
<v-hover v-slot="{ hover }">
  <v-button :color="hover ? red : blue" />
</v-hover>
```

## Delays

You can control how long the hover state persists after the user leaves the element with the `close-delay` prop. Likewise, you can set how long it will take before the hover state is set with the `open-delay` prop:

```html
<v-hover v-slot="{ hover }" :open-delay="250" :close-delay="400">
  <v-button :color="hover ? red : blue" />
</v-hover>
```
