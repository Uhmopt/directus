# Interfaces

Interfaces are the way of inputting, editing and viewing data. The most easy way to understand interface is a datepicker. It allows you to represent the date in specified format & you can validate the inputs. It renders the date in better way by providing a different UI than just a normal text.
In Database terms, interface represents the column's value.

## üí°Interfaces allows you to:

- Accept & View the data in different formats i.e. Datepicker, Dropdown, Checkboxes.
- Define the possible choices.
- Do RegEx validation of data.
- Define the database schema.

## ‚ö° Enhancements

- We can provide a prop named `savedValue` or similar which contains a value returned from an API, is immutable & changes only on successful crud. The `value` prop changes on user's interaction. Thus we can differentiate between server's state and user's state.
- The **Default** option interface should render the interface itself. This will enforce the valid default input.
